        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>I volunteered in a study as a requirement for my psychology lecture in university about three years ago. The study involved us learning how to code in javascript for beginners and we filled out a survey at the end about our experience.
          Overall, I thought it felt natural and I was surprised how easy it was to code. Last year I started to pick up coding again as I became interested in how hacking works and how there were ethical hackers as well. I did HTML and CSS for
          little bit. Then I tried learning some Python 3 and practing for and while loops. Right now I am taking a web development course on Udemy by <a class="angela" href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">Angela Yu</a>. I love the course and have
          learned a lot of useful information. I am comfortable with HTML and CSS so far and love being creative in the front-end development. I will continue learning other coding languages in the back-end of development very soon.</p>

        <h3>Tennis</h3>
        <p>Tennis is forever in my heart and soul. I started playing very young when I could barely lift a racket up off the ground. I played in many USTA tournaments and the school teams. In high school, I was on the varsity team all four years in
          all positions. I didn't get to play in college and I wish I did. I feel so lucky now that I get to be a part of my former high school tennis team as an assistant coach. I get to play tennis and help coach my team during matches. I do not
          know what my life would be like without tennis. I honestly cannot live without it.</p>
